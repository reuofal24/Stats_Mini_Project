# Stats_Mini_Project
## Python Project - Data Analysis
### In a small Python project using Google Colab, we worked with the Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset provided by Olist. This dataset contains information about orders, customers, products, and payments from 2016 to 2018. 
### - The goal of the project was to analyze this data to understand customer behavior and improve e-commerce strategies.

### We started the project with data exploration and preparation. We loaded the data, examined it, and cleaned it by handling missing values. Then, we conducted descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of key variables. This helped us get a clear picture of the data and its trends.

### Next, we performed hypothesis testing using A/B testing to evaluate certain impacts on sales. 

### Finally, we used Python libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Plotly, Scipy and Seaborn.
